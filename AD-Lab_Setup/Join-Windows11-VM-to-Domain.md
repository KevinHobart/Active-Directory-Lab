# Join Windows 11 VM to the Domain & Create a Domain User

This will be the final tutorial for setting up an Active Directory home lab. It will provide steps on how to join a Windows 11 VM to your Active Directory domain, followed by steps to create a new domain user for login. 
- Ensure both your **Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller** and **Windows 11 Client** are powered on, connected to the same network, and properly configured.

---

## Step 1: Verify Network Connectivity

1. On the **Windows 11 Client VM**, open **Command Prompt** and ping the domain controller.

   ```bash
   ping lab.local
   ```

   Replace `lab.local` with your actual domain name.

   - If the ping is successful, proceed.
   - If not, check your network settings and DNS configuration.

## Step 2: Rename the Windows 11 PC
Before joining the Windows 11 VM to the domain, you'll want to rename the PC so it is easily identifiable when viewed on the domain controller.  
- A good naming convention would be **WS01**.  This denotes it as Workstation 01.
- In the future, you can add more machines and continue with the naming scheme - WS02, WS03....WS21, and so on.
  
1. On the **Windows 11 Client VM**:
   - Open **Settings > System > About**
   - Click **Rename this PC**

2. Enter the new name: `WS01`

3. Click **Next**, then **Restart now** when prompted.

4. After restart, verify the name change by opening **Command Prompt** and typing:

   ```bash
   hostname
   ```

   It should return `WS01`.

## Step 3: Join Windows 11 to the Domain

1. On the **Windows 11 Client VM**:
   - Search for and select: **Access work or school**

2. Click **Connect**
   - Select **Join this device to a local Active Directory domain** in the pop up window.

   ![3domain_join](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6a107d1-4dbc-4554-aa1f-80a06e32566f)


3. Enter your domain name (e.g., `LAB.local`).
   - Click **Next**
     
   ![4domain_join](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/367f5cef-de8f-4c53-809e-8ea7535aa579)

   
4. Enter credentials for the domain user with permission to join the domain (this will be the administrator password you created to login to the server/domain controller):
   - **Username**: `administrator`
   - **Password**: *(your domain admin password)*
     
   ![5domain_join](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79711a53-dae0-4fb1-951e-b02b773a0521)

5. Leave defaults on the *Add an account* window
   - Click **Next**
     
   ![6domain_join](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20263fd0-9dbf-4cf8-bc18-f8a88f8beda4)

6. You will be prompted to restart. Click **Restart now**

---

## Step 4: Verify Domain Join

1. After reboot, on the **login screen**, you should see options to login as domain administrator (LAB\administrator, replace *LAB* with the name of your domain).

2. Go ahead and log in with the admin credentials, as we don't have any other users set up, yet.
   
   ![7domain_join](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fef31870-e860-4334-bc1a-463d6784b036)


3. You should now be logged into the domain as the administrator.

## Step 5: Create a New Domain User (on Server)
In this step, you will create a new domain user.  You will then be able log into your Windows 11 VM (Client machine) with the new users credentials.

1. On the **Windows Server 2022 Domain Controller**:
   - Open **Server Manager**, if not already open.
   - Click **Tools > Active Directory Users and Computers**

   ![9new_user](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c749504d-5068-4b0a-b073-e5fe3256515b)


2. In the left pane, expand your domain (LAB.local - replace *LAB* with your domain name).  
   - Before adding the new user:
       - Click on the **Computers** folder, you should see your WS01 computer listed.
       - Next, click on the **Domain Controllers** folder, you should see your DC01 domain controller listed.
         
3. Click on **Users**  
   - You will see Users listed, as well as built-in groups.  For organizational ease, we'll create another Organizational Unit (OU) to hold the groups:
     - **Right-click** on your domain (LAB.local), select **New**, select **Organizational Unit**.
       
       ![10new_user](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/422e1ba4-f38c-437d-8040-1ca148cd750c)

     - Name the Organizational Unit (OU) **Groups**, and click **OK**.
       ![11new_user](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e8e873d-41ee-483f-8d69-230b9904ff8e)

     - Click on th **Users** folder, select all of the Groups, and drag them to **Groups**
     - You will get a warning, just click **Yes**.  Read the warning to see why it's alerting you.  This doesn't affect the lab environment at this point, but will be important to know for future projects within this home lab.  
       ![12new_user](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6396a7e-16fb-4226-b188-89b6448707e8)


4. Click on **Users**
   - You will see **Administrator**, and **Guest**.
     - **Administrator** is the account you first set up for the server/domain controller.  This is SysAdmin account, and has the ability to make any changes within this Active Directory domain.
     - **Guest** is a built-in user.  Note that the *down arrow* next to **Guest** indicates that the account is disabled.
       ![13new_user](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06e36dab-13e1-4945-ad80-40ae443e4217)

   - **Right-click** on **Users**, select **New**, select **User**.
     ![14new_user](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7105f5e-7590-4f8d-8931-d6c70140eddf)

   - In the *New Object - User* window, fill in the following with the name of your choice:
   - **First name**: Jane
   - **Last name**: Smith
   - **User logon name**: jsmith
   - Click **Next**  
     ![15new_user](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c4b75a9-daf5-4eea-885e-6a3b015ebbb6)


5. Set a strong password:
   - Uncheck **User must change password at next logon**
   - Check **Password never expires** (easier for lab use)
   - Click **Next**, and then click **Finish**.
   - Reminder: to view Users and Computers, Click **Tools > Active Directory Users and Computers**
   ![16new_user](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef6564b9-3490-46c7-a452-4d62590edf6a)
   ![17new_user](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36842dd9-eb27-4d7d-a38a-664761d6605d)

## Step 6: Log In as Domain User

1. On the **Windows 11 Client VM**, sign out or restart the system.

2. On the login screen, click **Other user**.

3. Enter the new domain credentials:
   - **Username**: `user you created (e.g. bhill)`
   - **Password**: *(set in Step 5)*

   ![18user_login](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf501292-0249-4ebe-8759-2a96a83e12ce)


4. You should now be logged in as the new domain user!

## Notes

ðŸ’¡ If you're unable to join the domain, double-check:
- DNS points to the domain controller
- Firewall settings on the server
- That the client and server are on the same internal network

âœ… Joining a Windows 11 machine to a domain and creating domain users simulates a common enterprise setup and enables you to practice user management, group policies, permissions, etc, in an Active Directory environment.
